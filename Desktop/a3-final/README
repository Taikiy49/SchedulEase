how i created the react app
i had to clear the cache because i was running into some sort of issue creating the react app
```
npx clear-npx-cache 
npx create-react-app a3-final
```
 
to run the react app, make sure you have nodejs installed! IF U DONT HAVE THIS, UR PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN!
for mac users you can use homebrew:
``` 
brew install node
```
for windows or mac users don't have homebrew you can download and install node.js from their website

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
cd into the a3-final directory
then run...
```
npm start
```
